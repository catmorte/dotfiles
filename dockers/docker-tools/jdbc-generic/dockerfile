# Step 1: Build the application using a JDK
FROM openjdk:11-jdk-slim AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Java source file (index.java) from the root directory
COPY index.java /app/

# Copy the JSON library and other dependencies
COPY libs/ /app/lib/

# Compile the Java source code
RUN javac -cp "lib/*" -d /app/build/ /app/index.java

# Package the compiled classes into a JAR file
RUN jar cf /app/index.jar -C /app/build/ .

# Step 2: Create a new, minimal image for running the application
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/index.jar /app/index.jar

# Copy the JDBC drivers and dependencies
COPY libs/ /app/lib/

# Add all the libraries (JDBC drivers, JSON library) to the classpath
ENV CLASSPATH="/app/lib/*:/app/index.jar"

# Command to run the JAR with arguments passed during docker run
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "index"]

# docker run jdbc-json-app "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase" "your_username" "your_password" "SELECT * FROM mytable"
